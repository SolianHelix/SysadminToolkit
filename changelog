==============================================================================================
v1.0.0
	-Released on 11/5/2016
	-Initial release of software.

v1.0.1
	-Removed 'View WinObj Namespace' from pc diagnostics menu. I really dont have a use for it.
	-Removed 'Remove PUP Software' from Core menu. Other programs like MalwareBytes do this for us.
	-Added 'CoreTemp' to PC Diagnostics
	-Added 'CPU Stress Test' to PC Diagnostics. Uses Prime95 x86
	-Added 'GPU Stress Test' to PC Diagnostics. Uses FurMark x86
	-Added 'Network Stress Test' to PC Diagnostics. Uses iperf3 for client and server.

v1.0.2
	-Removed MalwareBytes from anti-malware menu. Installer file was making the toolkit too big and sluggish.
	-Removed Prime95 CPU stress test. Program was just as large as MalwareBytes, and FurMark already has a built in CPU burner.
	-Added more entries to bloatware list
	-Fixed bug where environment timer did not start upon load
	-Fixed MSERT bug where sub routine would not launch software after download had finished
	-Fixed extracting bugs where the sub routine would cause an infinite loop under certain conditions
	-Generic code optimization
	-Revamped credits screen

v1.1.0	Released 5/5/2017
	-Now have MD5 hash confirmation before we terminate any processes. As a result, we've had to rebuild the databases and start from scratch.
		-Kept the 'Read Only' option so we can see what matches we find without terminating them.
		-Kept the 'Force Terminate' option which just changes the kill signal sent to the programs
		-Added a 'Hail Mary' option. This is a last resort.
	-Fixed Internet Access label
	-Sped up init timing
	-Changed System Info to provide an option to save information found
	-Added HDD Scanner / Benchmark to PC Diagnostics menu
	-Added RogueKillerCMD Anti Malware to Anti Malware menu
	-Changed labels around, and corrected labels on buttons
	-Fixed progress bar, it actually works now!
	-Added a coffee button just incase ... you know ... I love coffee :)
	-Fixed Updates, program will now search for a new version only. Optimized update function.
	-Added two new functions to 'Misc Win Fixes', to reset startup of all windows 7 programs to default startup settings, and a new script that will force activate MS Office 201X products
	-Lots and LOTS of bug fixes
